I almost forgot to talk about the Terracotta Soldiers, which the group visited on a day trip a few days ago. This was perhaps the tourist activity that I was looking forward to the most prior to the trip, and it didn't disappoint. The soldiers are amazing to see in person. They are housed in several dig sites which are inside of massive hangars. Each soldier supposedly has a unique face, although a large majority of the statues are missing their heads at this point. Some workers have the fascinating day job of piecing together broken soldiers with tape and glue. 
<img class="post-img" src="img/terra1.jpg" alt="terracotta soldiers">
The statues are largely men, but there are also a few horses. Apparently there used to be chariots as well, but these were made of wood and decomposed quickly. Each soldier also used to be carrying a weapon and was painted. Today, none of the weapons or paint remain.

I leave this Saturday to take the overnight train back to Beijing. Then I will fly out on Sunday the 7th. I'm going to miss the country, the students, and the culture a huge deal. On the other hand, I'm looking forward to some clean air, blue sky, and rain that isn't acidic. Hopefully I can return in the future. Its been fun China - Farewell!

I set today aside as my free day. I wanted to explore the city a little more by myself, get lost, and see some sights. I got some breakfast and hit the streets. Somewhere along the south wall of the city, my exploration got cut short. I got shot in the ankle. Or at least I thought I had been shot in the ankle. When I looked down, there was the largest hornet I have ever seen stinging me THROUGH my sock. It's body was about two inches long and its wings must have been at least three. Luckily, I was wielding a bottle of iced tea at the time, so I proceeded to beat my ankle like a mad men. After this failed, I resorted to pulling it off my sock with my other hand. Then I ran.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
I got about a block feeling ok. Then my ankle started to feel like it was on fire. After two blocks I was actually limping. At this point I started to worry a bit and figured I'd better return to the hotel. I didn't want to go back the way I had come (godzilla bee was still alive somewhere), so I took some eastern alley ways. I got some great looks from the locals. A white person half-running through an alleyway, limping, and carrying an iced tea as if it were an assault rifle.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
When I got back to the hotel, the left side of my ankle around the sting was swollen to about 1.5 it's original size and burned like crazy. After 2-3 hours of cold soaking and some ibuprofen, it started to feel a bit better and return to it's normal size. After 3-4 hours, I could walk on it again. Thank you Xian wildlife.

					<div class="post-title">Rickshaw madness</div>
					<div class="post-date">SEPTEMBER 1, 2014</div>
				</div>
				<div class="post-underline"></div>
				<div class="post-content">
Today our entire group took rickshaws to get to our dinner location. Xian does not have the traditional hand-pulled, two-seater rickshaws. Xian has motorized four-seaters. Basically picture two small benches enclosed in a tiny room. Now strap that room to the back of a motorcycle. They can hit 50mph easy and can pull a U-turn in almost a single lane. 
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
Three others and myself hopped in the first rickshaw because the driver looked the most legitimate. Turns out you cant read a book by its cover. He closed the doors, revved the engine, and then proceeded to go full maniac. He immediately floored it and started weaving. Keep in mind that we were still on the sidewalk at this point, so people were literally diving out of the way. When we got to the first intersection, he sped up, cut off two lanes of moving traffic, and started driving between a bus and the road median.
<img class="post-img" src="img/rickshaw.jpg" alt="rickshaw">
We were screaming in the backseat this entire time. The driver was laughing at us and slapping his knee. He was spending more time watching our reactions in the rear-view mirror than the actual road. Its also  important to note here that the road medians in Xian are not small bumps. They are weighted fences. So you can't just drive over them. To get us to scream more, the driver started driving in the wrong lane, into oncoming traffic. He would find a gap in the median, swerve into oncoming traffic, start honking, and then swerve back through a median gap just before impact.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
When we got to the restaurant he drove up onto the sidewalk and started honking and swerving around walking pedestrians while going about 20mph. We made sure to get a picture with him afterwards (for legal reasons of course.)

Last night we took the overnight train to Xian, where we will be for the final week of our trip. 12 hours. The train ride was fun, although I wasn't able to sleep for very long. Too much rattling and shaking and honking.

We are in Old Xian, which is the original, walled off city. We rented bikes today and did a full loop around the city walls, which took us about two hours at a casual pace. 
<img class="post-img" src="img/bike.jpg" alt="bike">
The city is beautiful, with a mix of classic, pagoda-style buildings and high-rise apartments. There is an ancient bell tower in the heart of the city that lights up like a Christmas tree at night.

After spending sixteen hours straight in a coffee shop the previous day, we had our final presentation this morning. Every teams final presentation was very impressive. We all put a lot of time and effort in. It feels great to be done with the project but it was very sad to say goodbye to my team. We went out for a final lunch, played a little pool, and then parted ways. I tried to convince each of them to come back to Seattle with me.

My team and I have been keeping busy with our project, but I found some time today to visit a haggling mall in Yong'anli. I've never seen so many off-brand products in one location. Rolex, Beats, Louis-Viton - you name it. All for a price that said "this is not real." I bought some chopsticks, a tea set, some oolong tea, and a mahjong set. The total price was around 200 Yuan or $35 after an impressive amount of haggling. I also helped a couple of friends haggle a pair of Beats from 500 Yuan down to 150, the cheapest we could find from any vendor. I tested the sound quality later, and sure enough, they confirmed the phrase "this is not real." On our way out, a street vendor offered us a "Louis-Viton" handbag for just over three dollars. Riiiiight...

I took my first public Beijing bus today. I was able to scan my metro card (also used for the subway) and travel to a nearby cafe to meet up with my group. The bus ride cost me .4 Yuan. Keep that six-to-one exchange rate in mind. That's just over SIX CENTS. I know that Seattle Metro has been complaining about it's lack of funding lately, but seriously? Peak Seattle buses are over two dollars. It amazes me that our bus system is struggling with over thirty times the funding of the Beijing bus system.

If you have ever walked around downtown Seattle or the University of Washington campus, then you probably know the dangers that come with other people texting while walking. I have people run into me all the time on campus. At Peking University however, the threat is much more real. Most girls here walk around with umbrellas in broad daylight to protect their skin. Texting + walking + an umbrella = no fun for people around you. Fact.

I suppose at this point I owe an explanation of what I'm actually DOING here. The first week was mostly centered around meeting all of the other students and forming teams. This week has been much more focused on team project-time. Let me back up for a moment though and explain what the whole class is attempting to accomplish.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
This course is a product design course. Our topic is Offline-To-Online (O2O). O2O is the idea that future retail and business will be dominated by an omni-channel of offline and online experiences. In other words, a successful future business must merge physical store experience with modern technology. Each team can create any O2O solution for any problem. It could be an app, a piece of hardware, an article of clothing - whatever. As long as it merges some aspect of a physical business with technology.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
So. What am I making? Our team is designing what we call the SmartCart. The SmartCart is a traditional shopping cart with built-in sensor and screen technology. The cart itself is filled with empty shopping bags. As you shop, you can place items directly into the bags. When items pass through the rim of the cart, RFID sensors will scan the product and relay information directly to the screen attached to the cart. This way, we are eliminating the checkout process. The screen displays your total price and allows you to check out using mobile technology at any time. Then you just take your bags and go.
<img class="post-img" src="img/logo.png" alt="logo">
We are also incorporating features like a product search and side-by-side comparison. If you can't find something in the store, you can type it into the screen and receive instant directions. If you are having trouble with brand comparison, you can view products on the screen side-by-side to find exactly what you need.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
The whole of the project includes user studies, personas, cart prototyping, UI prototyping, technology research, business modeling, data modeling, and website development. It's still in it's early stages, but hopefully it will be a success.

				<div class="post-content">
Today we visited The Great Wall, actually known as The Long Wall by locals. We made two trips to get to the top. The first trip was a hike straight up a mountain. The hike eventually turned into rock climbing. The group I was hiking with gave up after about three hours due to the blazing sun and lack of water. We were only about 1/3 of the way to the top I think.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
Following this disappointment, we took a ski lift to the top of the wall. Definitely worth the extra money. The wall itself was pretty amazing. You can see and walk along it endlessly in both directions. It sometimes looks fake in the distance, like it's been painted onto the skyline. 
<img class="post-img" src="img/wall.jpg" alt="wall">
When we finished exploring, we took the slide back down. Picture a metal playground slide that switchbacks down an entire mountain. Each person sits on a cart that has a brake. If you don't brake, you will constantly pick up speed. The cart itself was actually just a pair of small skis with Styrofoam on the bottom. The brake was just a block of Styrofoam that would contact the slide and slow the cart down with friction. Cheap and effective. It took about 10 minutes to reach the bottom, with a max speed of maybe 15-20mph.

My team went to a food chain called Xiabu Xiabu today. They serve Taiwanese hotpot. Each person selects a broth, which is then heated in the pot in front of you. We ordered a variety of mushrooms, meats, and vegetables to go with it. When the pot begins to boil, you add whatever ingredients you want, wait for them to cook, and then enjoy. It was not only delicious, but a great social activity. Following lunch we returned to the classroom to take a nap. Yup. A nap. Almost all of the students here take a nap after lunch. It took me awhile to get used to.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
We also visited the Summer Palace tonight with a picnic dinner. We got to walk around the park, take a boat ride to the other side, and see an amazing sunset. We hauled a whole watermelon through the subway system with us as well. It was worth it - every single watermelon here tastes like that one-in-a-million perfect Seattle watermelon.

We had a group dinner tonight at the "second best" duck restaurant in Beijing. Beijing is famous for it's duck. Chefs cart out whole ducks and carve them at the table for you. Very fun and very delicious. The restaurant we went to served duck with every course. The appetizer included fried duck webbing and duck liver. At this point in the trip, I think the duck liver is the best thing I've had so far. Very rich, smooth texture, a bit greasy, packed with flavor. The duck webbing on the other hand - not so much. Kind of like chewing soft, flavorless cartilage.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
The main course was of course the duck itself. While carving, they cut the skin off separately but leave it on each piece of meat. The duck goes in a little rice wrap (sort of like a small tortilla) with a slice of cucumber, some sweet brown sauce, and a little bit of sugar. I created two wraps, then got lazy and just started eating the duck straight. The dessert included duck bone soup. It was delicious but at this point I was already fit to burst.

Today was one of our most important class days. We formed the project teams that we will be in for the next two and a half weeks. After lecture, those of us that had project ideas were given about thirty seconds to pitch our ideas to the entire class. I had just come up with an idea that I wanted to pitch that morning but I went for it anyway. I was one of the last of about fifteen students to pitch an idea. 
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
With a class of about sixty students, the goal was to end up with ten teams of six students. Nobody wanted their pitch idea to be left behind, and everybody wanted a strong team. After the business pitches were over, it was a mad scramble to recruit balanced groups of six. Preferably one manager, one technologist, one information analyst, one user analyst, one business analyst, and one user experience (UX) specialist. I was lucky enough to have a large number of students interested in my pitch and I was able to form one of the first teams with a strong mix of students.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
The idea that I briefly pitched was to create some form of digitized shopping cart. Barcode sensors can scan products as they enter the cart and provide real-time data to both the consumer's technology as well as the store. I will describe the project more in detail soon.

Today was the first day of class. We have a class of about sixty students. Fifteen are from the UW and the other forty-five are from all over Asia. Very few actually attend Peking University but most are from other nearby Chinese universities. We have had a few opportunities to meet all of the other students and everyone seems very nice. Chinese students seem much more friendly than Americans in general - everybody wants to meet you and talk to you... and take your picture.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
We finally visited the night market today, something we've been meaning to do since we arrived in Beijing. I have never seen so many people crammed into a single location. The night market was somewhere in central Beijing, so the human traffic jam actually started on the subway. Imagine a small bus. Now picture it with all of its seats full. Now cram people into the aisles until there is no space left between anyone. Now stack a second layer of people on top of those that still have head room. Finally, stuff people into the overhead bins. That was our subway ride.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
The night market was what I just described... Doubled.
<img class="post-img" src="img/market.jpg" alt="market">
It was well worth it though. The night market was actually more like a series of alley ways, each about 10 feet wide. Shops lined the edges and vendors were constantly trying to yell over each other, attempting to catch the eye of tourists while exhibiting a wide variety of merchandise.
<img class="post-img" src="img/fruit.jpg" alt="fruit">
Several stalls were selling live scorpions on a stick and also breaded starfish. The scorpions were particularly interesting because they were constantly pinching their claws and wriggling their legs. Together they looked like a sea of angry spiders. Nobody in our group had the guts to try one.

Some of us went to BeiHai park today. BeiHai is a massive and absolutely gorgeous park. It vaguely resembles green lake, with a path around the outside of the lake. The lake was covered in small boats and the path was covered in photographers. 
<img class="post-img" src="img/lake.jpg" alt="lake">
We walked around for awhile and then paid for a lotus boat (a boat that resembles a flower with each seat being a petal.) The boat had a single lever to steer. We went out for about an hour and took some excellent photos. We almost tipped the boat at one point trying to get a picture of all of us on one side together.
<img class="post-img" src="img/boat.jpg" alt="boat">
After we returned to campus, our full group took a tour of the campus. Peking University has several well-known landmarks. The tower and the lake are the main two. Both are very beautiful. We were told that most families in Beijing bring their children to visit Peking University (if they can get in the gate that is...) to show them these landmarks.  
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
In the evening we tried out the night life. A couple of Chinese students took us to a bar. By "took us" I mean we walked. And walked. And walked... The closest bar from the Global Village is apparently about forty minutes away. And it is one of only about three or four in the area. The bar turned out to be more of a club, with more flashing lights and lounge areas than actual people. Not a whole lot happening on a Sunday night. It was fun though. We were all tired so none of us stayed too late.

Today was the day that our program officially started. Therefore, we had to pack up from our hotel and find our new housing just outside Peking University. This proved to be more difficult than it should have been. Instead of walking across the south side of campus, we walked up the west side and attempted to cut directly through campus. It made sense on paper. Unfortunately, it just so happens that Peking University is a hotspot for local tourism. So much so that Peking has walls around the entire campus. Each gate is guarded and fenced off. To get in, you must have a student card or visitor's pass. We had neither. So we ended up carrying our luggage all the way back down the west side of campus, across the south side, then up the east side. A solid workout.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
Us Americans are staying in The Global Village, which is poorly named for a couple of reasons. Real Peking dormitories are very, very small. Some don't have air conditioning and some don't have showers. I've been told that some of the campus housing will be torn down next year because it is so gross inside. However, on-campus housing is also free for Peking students. The "Global" Village is really just a westernized dormitory for international students, mostly Europeans and Americans. No complaints here about having a western toilet instead of a pit toilet though.

My first opportunity to haggle was a bit unorthodox. In fact it didn’t turn out to be a haggle at all. 
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
Before leaving the US, I was warned by numerous friends and family members to beware of street vendor prices and to be ready to haggle. I like haggling. It's empowering and comes with a sense of satisfaction when I can get that knick-knack for 25% off. Plus it's not something I get to do everyday in the US. So on our first full day I was 100% ready to haggle anything and everything that I needed to purchase.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
In 85 degree weather, that first purchase happened to be water. A friend and I found a street vendor just around the corner from our hotel that was selling refrigerated water. We pointed to water and she held up fingers. It was a fair price so we paid without haggling. She said no. So we gave her some more money. She still said no. Then she handed most of the money back because we had misunderstood her hand signs and were overpaying by quite a bit on accident.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
Turns out not all the street vendors in Beijing are trying to get the Yuan out of your pocket.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
Today was our first full day in Beijing. We chose the Beijing Olympic Park and the Temple of Heaven as the first two places we wanted to see. We took the subway to both and quickly learned where to buy tickets and what routes to take. The Beijing Olympic Park is free to walk around in, but you have to pay to get into any of the buildings. We walked down the main road for awhile and took some photos of the interesting architecture around us. We eventually paid 50 Yuan to enter the Olympic Stadium. The stadium is gigantic and we were exhausted after climbing to the top level. We rested for awhile and explored the lower levels but there wasn't actually that much to see. In the center of the stadium, construction crews were putting together what looked to be a large musical stage.
<img class="post-img" src="img/stad.jpg" alt="stadium">
The Temple of Heaven turned out to be more of a park. Inside the park we visited the main temple itself, Echo Wall, and the Circular Mound. It took us a solid hour to walk from one of the park to the other.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
Some of the Beijing locals seems to have a fascination with foreigners. I get a lot of looks while walking down the street. But not in an unfriendly way. A large number of people have actually approached myself and others in my group and asked to take pictures with us. Families in particular seem to want a picture of their son or daughter with me. Its weird but I feel famous in an odd way.
<img class="post-img" src="img/toh.jpg" alt="temple">
I also learned valuable lesson today: flip flops are not appropriate footwear for the subway. Use your imagination.

Myself and two other travelers took two flights to reach Beijing. An eleven-hour flight to Seoul, Korea followed by a two-hour flight to Beijing. We flew on Korean Air, which turned out to be an excellent experience. There were three full meals, snacks every hour, water every fifteen minutes, steamed towels, blankets, slippers, and an awesome screen interface for watching movies, listening to music, and tracking the flight.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
The Seoul airport is massive. It took us almost twenty minutes just to walk to our next gate. Unlike SeaTac, gates are not all next to each other. Instead there is one gate followed by three or four upscale shopping centers. I'd actually describe it as more like a mall than an airport. The stores weren't just McDonalds or GAP clothing either. They were Gucci, Rolex, and Louis Viton. To my surprise, once we boarded the plane, a huge amount of people brought shopping bags on with them. I guess next time I stop in Seoul I'll have to pick up a new suit and gold-plated watch.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
When we finally got to Beijing we had no trouble at all finding the Airport Express subway. The subway made a horrible screeching noise for the better part of the trip, but I was too busy watching the scenery to really care. Beijing looks a bit like downtown Seattle. Tall buildings, bright lights. Except everything is gray. The sky is gray with pollution instead of clouds and sometimes if you look down a very long street, it looks like fog is rolling in.
<div class="post-spacer"></div>
We transferred once and got off at ZhongGuanCun at about 10pm. It took us about an hour to find our hotel, which was actually only about fifteen minutes away. We ended up on the wrong side of a highway and had to take a massive detour to cross it. The hotel itself was nice. I've never seen so much Ikea furniture in one building. It gave the rooms a modern yet cheap sort of feel. At this point we were all exhausted, so we crashed as soon as we hit the beds.
